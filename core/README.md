# tgtracker_core

Core functionality in tgtracker should be **primarily** in Rust, for speed and accuracy purposes. After much experimentation with binding to and transpiling C/C++ code to Rust, I've realized that automated tools are somewhat young and though many great bindings exist for various projects, creating your own for non-existent tools you need isn't easy to get right. Most often the best bindings are semi-handwritten by folks familiar with these languages. I am still new to all this so the first specification phase will focus on the core and how much code can be pure Rust.

Early on in my (ongoing) wild tracker idea phase I wanted to incorporate the ChucK language because it was so fun and concise. I soon learned this presented a challenge and in the process learned alot about both ecosystems.
