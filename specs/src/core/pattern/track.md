- [ ] Range is usually 1 - 8, 1 - 16, 1 - 32, etc.
- [ ] Each channel has its own basic automation envelopes (volume, panning...)
- [ ] Channels and busses can be labeled ("Drums", "Bass", "Vocals", "Mixdown", etc.)
- [ ] Channels can be soloed and muted

Busses are special channels for summing (mixing down) channels and applying effects. A natural limit should be established for the maximum number of busses, i.e. 2 - 4

- The master channel is a special bus that sums all channels not routed to a bus
