//@ The MilkyTracker mode basically is a bit more "modern" because you can focus on different parts (e.g. Pattern Editor, Instrument listbox, Sample listbox etc.) and when you're pressing keys, they're routed to the focused control. Keyboard shortcuts are also more standard; you can select by pressing the SHIFT key and navigating with the cursor keys, cut, copy & paste by using Ctrl-X/C/V etc. Users who are new to tracking will probably find this a bit more intuitive.
