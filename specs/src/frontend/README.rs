//@ ## Frontends
//@
//@ As I've tried different GUI toolkits I found I couldn't decide on a single one to use. They each have their pros and cons, so early on I decided to separate the core tracker engine from the frontend, so that others can design a frontend around the core using pretty much whatever they want. The frontend specs, though written in Rust, can be applied to other languages. One idea involves the OCaml and ReasonML ecosystem using Revery.

//@ This is definitely the murkier side of tonal glyph tracker that hasn't fully materialized yet, so I welcome your feedback.
