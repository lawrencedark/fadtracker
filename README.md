IMPORTANT: This project is still in the planning and sandbox phase. Please see Projects and Issues for current progress.

tgtracker will be a digital audio workstation with a tracker-inspired interface. It will be written primarily in Rust.

## Goals

- Cross-platform
- Low latency
- Embeddable in game engines/music applications
- Portable/serializable data
- Use new technologies like Vulkan and Webassembly
- Unique interface and document format
- MIDI and OSC support

## Non-goals

- Backwards compatability w/ existing modules (XM, IT, etc.) but import to native format would be nice

## History

I first encountered the demoscene in 1996. I used FastTracker and MadTracker to take apart existing modules and make my own. I have wanted since those years to make a tracker of my own. I am new to systems programming so I need all the help I can get for this project.
